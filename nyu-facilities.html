      <p class="subheader">New York University houses approximately 12,000 students every year on campus dorms.</p>
      <p class="body">Inspired by my own experience with dorming (ask me about the time my room flooded), I decided to take on the challenge to improve the current facilities and maintenance system for students and faculty. Since dorms are owned by NYU, residents must file a work request to get any maintenace issues fixed.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row row-paragraph">
    <div class="col xl8 offset-xl2 l10 offset-l1 m12 s12">
      <p class="subheader">Current Situation</p>
      <p class="body">Currently, NYU has a Client Services Center that handles all maintenance requests across campus, including dorms. The process should be simple: students fill out a work request form, and facilities comes by to fix the issue.</p>
      <p class="body">However, many students complain about the process. The most common complaints documented during the user interviews I conducted are:
        <ul>
          <li class="list">Selecting which building you are located in on the form <b>isn’t intuitive</b> enough (more on that later)</li>
          <li class="list">Completed request emails are sent to students <b>without the problem being fixed</b></li>
          <li class="list">There are <b>no indications</b> when facilities workers are coming by, and facilities will <b>let themselves in</b> if they think no one is home, which leads to <b>awkward & embarrassing</b> run-ins</li>
          <li class="list">When someone files a work request, they often <b>don’t communicate</b> it with the other roommates which makes the other roommates’ run-ins with facility workers <b>confusing</b></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row row-paragraph">
    <div class="col xl8 offset-xl2 l10 offset-l1 m12 s12">
      <p class="subheader">Client Service Center</p>
      <p class="body">I also looked at this challenge through the lens of facility workers. Facility workers go through dozens of work requests on a daily basis. With limited amount of employees fixing requests around multiple locations across Manhattan and Brooklyn, their schedules get pretty hectic.</p>

      <p class="subheader">Research Synthesis</p>
      <p class="body">Based on my user interviews, I realized that the main issue with the current system is lack of communication. Students have troubles immediately after they submit a request, wondering what happens next? Facilities workers have trouble with trying to juggle the dozens of requests they get without being able to talk to the requestor for more clarity first.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row row-paragraph">
    <div class="col l4 offset-l1 push-l6 m12 s12">
      <p class="body">This is what NYU’s work request form currently looks like. Most students are not fans of the experience of this process. The design itself is also outdated, and doesn't quite comply with NYU's general branding guidelines.</p>
      <p class="body">The work request form is also currently accessible to everyone on the internet, which is ridiculous because it makes it easy for non-NYU users to access the form.</p>

      <p class="body">The number one complaint about this form (as previously mentioned) is the building selection process. Some buildings are listed as their address (725 Broadway), and some listen by the building name (Bobst Library), which is inconsistent and confusing to the user.</p>

      <p class="body">Finally, I designed the work request experience, following NYU’s <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/employees/resources-and-services/media-and-communications/styleguide/website/graphic-visual-design.html" target="_blank">branding guidelines</a> to design a form more fitted to their aesthetic. I designed and prototyped these high-fidelity screens using <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/KxwY0fMnNiZJ3I2O0csZSm/Work-Request-Form?node-id=0%3A1" target="_blank">Figma</a>.</p>

      <p class="body">This makes the process more internal by preventing outsiders from being able to fill out the form, and also prevents students from filling out the form wrong if their email, dorm room, etc. is already in the system.</p>

      <p class="body"><b>Work Request</b></p>
      <p class="body">Since the request form can only be accessed through an NYU login, information like the first and last name, email, and dorm information are already filled out. However, the phone number section is left blank so the user can input another number if needed.</p>
      <p class="body">A new feature is that users can add images of the issue if they want to. This makes it easier for facility workers to assess request and see if they have the means to fix it. Users also have the option to send a copy of the confirmation to their roommates. This is good for issues in communal spaces like the bathroom. They also can opt out of this option, but the default selection is to send a confirmation to roommates.</p>

      <p class="body">Overall, I had a great time with this challenge, and it really gave me an opportunity to improve something within my school that I’m passionate about (as an ex-dormer) and that my fellow students also wanted to see fixed!</p>
