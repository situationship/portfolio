      <p class="subheader">The Pink Tax refers to the "extra charges placed on products and services directed toward women"</a>.</p>
      <p class="body">Women pay more for everyday items <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dca/downloads/pdf/partners/Study-of-Gender-Pricing-in-NYC.pdf" target="_blank">42%</a> of the time, which includes personal hygiene products, clothing, toys, haircuts, and more. This, along with the gender wage gap, makes it more difficult for women to live day-by-day.</p>
      <p class="body">For a UX Design project at NYU, I wanted to try and tackle this issue. The first step was to figure out the problem, beyond the obvious fact that the pink tax exists. Are people aware of the pink tax? Do they proactively work against the system? I wanted to understand how women currently spend their money, if they bother comparing female-oriented products to their male counterparts.</p>

      <p class="subheader">User Reseach</p>
      <p class="body">I conducted interviews around the NYU area, particularly targeting women. I asked them various questions about their shopping habits, how they decided what products to spend money on, and then asked if they are aware of what the pink tax is. From my research, I discovered that:
        <ul>
          <li>People know only a few things about the pink tax</li>
          <li>Most women do not shop in the men’s sections</li>
          <li>People rely heavily on online reviews and recommendations from friends</li>
          <li>Customers have brand loyalty, but are open to exploring new options</li>
          <li>People care about ingredients in a product, but do not know how ingredients affect them</li>
        </ul>

      <p class="subheader">Research Synthesis</p>
      <p class="body">To create a solution to this problem, I analyzed and sort through the research I had done online and through my interviews. After observing my interviewees' pain points, I had to ask myself:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col xl8 offset-xl2 l12">
      <p class="subheader">How might we help women understand the pink tax and take action to fight against it?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col xl10 offset-xl1 l12">
      <p class="body">From there, I created a new problem statement and hypothesis.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col l5 offset-l1 m6">
      <p class="body"><b>Problem Statement</b></p>
      <p class="body">Women need a way to easily compare the quality and price of their purchases, because they want to save money and spend the same amount for said items as men do.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col l5 m6">
      <p class="body"><b>Hypothesis</b></p>
      <p class="body">I believe that by creating a feature that can evaluate and compare similar items marketed for different genders, we can fight against an unjust system that expects women to pay more for products.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col xl10 offset-xl1 l12">
      <p class="body">I compared my potential product to two other popular retail apps, Amazon and Target.com. Although both are widely well-known and used throughout the country, these two competitors did not have any features that could benefit their female customers by fighting against the pink tax.</p>

    <div class="col m12">
      <img src="media\pink-tax\competitive-analysis-min.jpg" alt="Competitive Analysis">
      <p class="caption">All of these competitors did not fulfill the desires that the interviewees wanted while shopping online and in person.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col xl10 offset-xl1 l12">
      <p class="body">At this point, I realized that I should create something that was also retail-based, or would at least use the data provided by popular retail brands. I also knew that I wanted to focus on personal hygiene products, since the price disparity between different genders was the highest for that category, and also because personal hygiene products are frequently used and repurchased. To understand what features of my app should be prioritize, I created 2x2 matrix that mapped the users' needs and the business' needs.</p>

      <p class="subheader">Conclusion</p>
      <p class="body">I conducted two rounds of user testing, editing this prototype after every round. This prototype is the second implementation, feel free to play with the full interaction <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/3b3699e9-d80c-4870-459c-67f6cffb4578-4d07/" title="The Pink Tax on Adobe XD" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
      <p class="body">This project was my first exposure to the full UX design process, and my biggest takeaway from this project is empathy— understanding the users' pain points and fully implementing my creativity to come up with a solution. The pink tax is a topic I've been passionate about for many years now, and my previous conceptions on how people understood the pink tax were challenged after my interviews.</p>
      <p class="body">So what's next for this project? Although this prototype is already quite intricate and high-fidelity, I've thought it would be cool to add some sort of "social media" aspect, so users with accounts can share their preferences on items with others. Overall, I had a great time with this project and I enjoyed digging into my creative side while designing my own mobile app!</p>
